Exercise- Draw a picture
========================
Create something (anything!) beautiful with the drawing tools. For instance, we
made the following image: 

![Flower](lab-picture-1.jpg)

The image above plays around with pen color and pen size. If you want to create
more complex images, you probably want to use broadcasts to delegate the drawing
of different parts of the image. For example, we used the following broadcasts
for the image above:

![Flower](lab-picture-2.gif)

*Tip*: Your images will draw more quickly if you use ![Hide](lab-picture-3.gif)
to hide the character.

**This is a project grade - You should use all of the skills you have learned.**
 * Broadcasts
 * Looping
 * Variables (if appropriate)
 * Drawing
