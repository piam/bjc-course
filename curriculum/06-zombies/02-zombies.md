Week 2
======

Let’s Talk!
-----------

Last week, we talked about getting some extra data to help figure out who patient zero is and how patient zero spread the virus across the Lower Mainland. This week, we managed to get some extra data for you by mining cell phone data, Facebook check-in, Instagram metadata, VISA records, and Google tracking history. We’ve managed to find where people have gone in the last fifteen days. 

What should you do with the data now?
Talk about what info you can get out of it by combining the two datasets?
Remind them that they have a group of people they are interested in
Do we want to have an ethics discussion about whether or not tracking should be turned on?

Find the data here. (put link to data here)
Try importing the data into Google Maps. Does it help? (Should we bother? It seems kind of pointless since we already did this last week)
Take the PIDs of the possible patient zero candidates and only map the locations of those people.
Can you find one person whose path intersected with all the others? If you can’t, did you manage to narrow down the patient zero candidates? Who are they?

Deliverable

Email your TA with the following subject title,** <Section Number> CPSC 100 Data Visualization Lab Answers- Week 2**. Emails received without this title will not be marked. Your email should contain answers to the following questions:

* What is the pid of patient zero (give pid) or what are the pids of the group of people you think patient zero is in? 
* What method did you use to come up with your answer? 
* Why do you think you correctly identified patient zero? Were there any places in your methodology where error could have been introduced? (Just briefly tell us this in a few sentences.**Do not exceed four sentences- anything after four sentences will not be marked**).
