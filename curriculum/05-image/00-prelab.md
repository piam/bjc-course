Image Processing Pre-Lab
====================

In our image processing lab, we will be working with some colorful images and manipulating them by desaturating part of the image. That means we will select a part of the image to keep all its colour while removing colour from the rest of it. 

For your pre-lab, find an image you think would be fun to play with!

Part 1: Find a colourful image to manipulate
--------------------------------------------

Let's start by finding an image that you want to desaturate - we suggest something colourful.

Try using this [search tool](https://search.creativecommons.org/) to find images under the Creative Commons (CC) license.

When you have selected an image,make sure you have the URL handy!

Here's an example of what we will do to a image:
