Image Processing Pre-Lab
====================

In our image processing lab we will be working w/ some colorful images and manipulating them by desaturating part of image. That means we will select a part of the image to keep all it's colour while removing colour from the rest of it. 

For your pre-lab, find an image you think would be fun to play with!

--------------------------------------------

Let's start by finding an image that you want to desaturate, we suggest something colourful.

Try using this [search tool](https://search.creativecommons.org/) to find images under the creative commons license
